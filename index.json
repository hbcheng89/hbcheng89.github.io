Unlike single-factor authentication (e.g., password-only login), $t$-factor authentication ($t$FA) requires a user *always* to carry and present $t$ specified factors so as to strengthen the security of login. Nevertheless, this may restrict user experience in limiting the flexibility of factor usage, e.g., the user may prefer to choose any factors *at hand* for login authentication. To bring back usability and flexibility without loss of security, we introduce a new notion of authentication, called $(t,n)$ *threshold MFA*, that allows a user to actively choose $t$ factors out of $n$ based on preference. We further define the ‚Äúmost-rigorous‚Äù multi-factor security model for the new notion, allowing attackers to control public channels, launch active/passive attacks, and compromise/corrupt any subset of parties as well as factors. We state that the model can capture the most practical security needs in the literature. We design a threshold MFA key exchange (T-MFAKE) protocol built on the top of a threshold oblivious pseudorandom function and an authenticated key exchange protocol.  Our protocol achieves the ‚Äúhighest-attainable‚Äù security against all attacking attempts in the context of parties/factors being compromised/corrupted.  As for efficiency, our design only requires $4+t$ exponentiations, $2$ multi-exponentiations and $\\mathbf{2}$ communication rounds.  Compared with existing $t$FA schemes, even the degenerated $(t,t)$ version of our protocol achieves the strongest security (stronger than most schemes) and higher efficiency on computational and communication.  We instantiate our design on real-world platform to highlight its practicability and efficiency.","tags":["CCF-A"],"title":"Practical Threshold Multi-Factor Authentication","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Haibo Cheng","Âê≥ÊÅ©ÈÅî"],"categories":["Demo","ÊïôÁ®ã"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

This approach was Ô¨Årst proposed by Juels and Rivest at CCS‚Äô13, and has been covered by hundreds of medias and also adopted in various research domains. The idea of honeywords looks deceptively simple, but it is a deep and sophisticated challenge to automatically generate honeywords that are hard to differentiate from real passwords. In JuelsRivest‚Äôs work, four main honeyword-generation methods are suggested but only justiÔ¨Åed by heuristic security arguments.\n\nIn this work, we for the Ô¨Årst time develop a series of practical experiments using 10 large-scale datasets, a total of 104 million real-world passwords, to quantitatively evaluate the security that these four methods can provide. Our results reveal that they all fail to provide the expected security: real passwords can be distinguished with a success rate of 29.29%‚àº32.62% by our basic trawling-guessing attacker, but not the claimed 5%, with just one guess (when each user account is associated with 19 honeywords as recommended). This Ô¨Ågure reaches 34.21%‚àº49.02% under the advanced trawling-guessing attackers who make use of various state-of-the-art probabilistic password models. We further evaluate the security of Juels-Rivest‚Äôs methods under a targeted-guessing attacker who can exploit the victim‚Äô personal information, and the results are even more alarming: 56.81%‚àº67.98%. Overall, our work resolves three open problems in honeyword research, as deÔ¨Åned by Juels and Rivest.","tags":["CCF-B"],"title":"A Security Analysis of Honeywords","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ding Wang","Haibo Cheng","Ping Wang","Xinyi Huang","Gaopeng Jian"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

In this paper, we make a substantial step forward toward understanding this foundational question. By introducing a number of computational statistical techniques and based on 14 large-scale data sets, which consist of 113.3 million real-world passwords, we, for the first time, propose two Zipf-like models (i.e., PDF-Zipf and CDF-Zipf) to characterize the distribution of passwords. More specifically, our PDF-Zipf model can well fit the popular passwords and obtain a coefficient of determination larger than 0.97; our CDF-Zipf model can well fit the entire password data set, with the maximum cumulative distribution function (CDF) deviation between the empirical distribution and the fitted theoretical model being 0.49%~4.59% (on an average 1.85%). With the concrete knowledge of password distributions, we suggest a new metric for measuring the strength of password data sets. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness and general applicability of the proposed Zipf-like models and security metric.","tags":["CCF-A"],"title":"Zipf‚Äôs Law in Passwords","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ding Wang","Debiao He","Haibo Cheng","Ping Wang"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

It is a rare bit of good news in password research that well-designed PSMs do help improve the strength of user-chosen passwords. However, leading PSMs in the industrial world (e.g., Zxcvbn, KeePSM and NIST PSM) are mainly composed of simple heuristic rules and found to be highly inaccurate, while state-of-the-art PSMs from academia (e.g., probabilistic context-free grammar based ones and Markov-based ones) are still far from satisfactory, especially incompetent at gauging weak passwords. As preventing weak passwords is the primary goal of any PSM, this means that existing PSMs largely fail to serve their purpose.\n\nTo fill this gap, in this paper we propose a novel PSM that is grounded on real user behavior. Our user survey reveals that when choosing passwords for a new web service, most users (77.38%) simply retrieve one of their existing passwords from memory and then reuse (or slightly modify) it. This is in vast contrast to the seemingly intuitive yet unrealistic assumption (often implicitly) made in most of the existing PSMs that, when user registers, a whole new password is constructed by mixing segments of letter, digit and/or symbol or by combining n-grams. To model users' realistic behaviors, we use passwords leaked from a less sensitiveservice as our base dictionary and another list of relatively strong passwords leaked from a sensitive service as our training dictionary, and determine how mangling rules are employed by users to construct passwords for new services. This process automatically creates a fuzzy probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) and gives rise to our fuzzy-PCFG-based meter, fuzzyPSM. It can react dynamically to changes in how users choose passwords and is evaluated by comparisons with five representative PSMs. Extensive experiments on 11 real-world password lists show that fuzzyPSM, in general, outperforms all its counterparts, especially accurate in telling apart weak passwords and suitable for services where online guessing attacks prevail.","tags":["CCF-B"],"title":"fuzzyPSM: A New Password Strength Meter Using Fuzzy Probabilistic Context-Free Grammars","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
